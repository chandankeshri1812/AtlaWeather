# AtlaWeather


"One stop for all weather information. Get up-to-date weather forecasts from your city with the AltaWeather website"

I am very excited to post my first ever project on web development, a simple weather forecast. The whole process for building this project was so exciting and engaging. 

The weather forecast you need, get it on this platform no matter where you live.
AltaWeather is a website that delivers current temperatures for any city all over the world by entering its name and also you can see the weather fluctuating in different parts of the world as it updates. It also provides detailed weather forecasts with pressure, humidity, wind, etc.
If you are visiting pages which doesn't exist in AltaWeather website then it will appear not 404 error page not found. 
I will try to add more features to this project as soon as I learn. This website is fully responsive. I have provided a link given below you can also visit and search your city and i also provided my GitHub link.

I started learning and after few months finally I have reached to my first project of Web Development using Node Js. I have used Html, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Node Js and Express Js...
